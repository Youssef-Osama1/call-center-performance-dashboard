# Call Center Performance Dashboard

This project was developed as part of an **interview task for a major company**.  
The company provided a detailed **Business Requirements Document**, outlining the KPIs, data transformation rules, and reporting expectations.

Using only **Microsoft Excel**, I transformed four raw datasets (`Call Log`, `CSAT`, `Roaster`, `Calendar`) into a fully interactive performance dashboard, applying:
- **Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation
- **Power Pivot** for data modeling and DAX measures
- **Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts** for interactive reporting

---

## ðŸ”§ Data Transformation & Modeling
- Cleaned and standardized 4 datasets: `Call Log`, `CSAT`, `Roaster`, `Calendar`.
- Fixed time formats and converted durations into both `hh:mm:ss` and `decimal minutes`.
- Built calculated columns:
  - `Call Duration = Talk + Hold + ACW`
  - `AHT`, `Answer Speed`, `Numeric CSAT Score`
- Created a data model in **Power Pivot** with relationships and hierarchies.

## ðŸ“ˆ KPI Metrics & Dashboard Design
- KPIs tracked:
  - **Offered Calls**
  - **Answer Rate (AR)**
  - **Service Level % (SL)**
  - **Customer Satisfaction % (CSAT)**
  - **Average Speed of Answer (ASA)**
  - **Average Handle Time (AHT)**
  - **Composite KPI Score**
- Interactive visuals:
  - Daily Call Volume
  - Top 10 Agents by Call Volume
  - Top 5 Agents by KPI Score
  - Answer Rate & Service Level trends
  - Rating Distribution
  - Team Leader Performance
- Slicers for Month, Week, and Team Leader.
